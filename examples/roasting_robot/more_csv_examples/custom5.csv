back_dock_nearby.wav,"<speak>Oh, look at thatâ€”I <emphasis>can't</emphasis> reach the dock because there's a mountain of your stuff in the way. Could you, pretty please, remove these obstacles? Or is that asking too much?</speak>"

error10.wav,"<speak>Oh look, it's Error 10 telling you to check the filter. If it's wet, use a dry one. If it's dry, clean it, and try again. Or, you know, you could just ignore it like you do with everything else.</speak>"
